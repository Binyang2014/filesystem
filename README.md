#file system

a distributed file storage system based on memory

##introducton

This program is a distributed in memory file system which based on MPI framework. You can use this system by calling APIs we provide. The data you stored in our system will not write on hard disk, so you can only write and read temporary files in our system.
Our system aimed to provide high write and read throughput for access memory intensive applications, and will support hundreds of nodes.

## Installation

Make sure your computer installed MPI environment before.
